# Svelte Table

**Svelte Table** is a lightweight, headless table component built for Svelte, designed to give you full control over your table’s appearance without sacrificing essential features like sorting, filtering, and pagination. With Svelte’s reactivity at its core, it's fast, flexible, and fun to use.

## 🚀 Project Status

Svelte Table is in its early stages — we kicked things off just a couple of weeks ago! 🛠️  
While it’s still a work in progress, the foundations are strong, and we're actively developing key features to make it easier for Svelte devs to manage tables without the usual headaches.

If you love clean code, flexible customization, and smooth performance, **Svelte Table** is one to watch.

## 🎯 Goals

Our mission is simple: **Make tables easier and more enjoyable to work with in Svelte.** Here’s what we’re focusing on:

- **Simplicity**: Offer a clean, intuitive API that’s a breeze to work with.
- **Customization**: Give you total freedom over the look and feel of your table.
- **Performance**: Handle large datasets without breaking a sweat (or your browser).

## ✨ Features (In Progress)

Svelte Table leverages the power of **Svelte 5's runes** for reactivity and lightning-fast performance. Here are the core features you can expect (some are still baking in the oven):

- **Pagination**: Easily manage large datasets by showing one page at a time.
- **Filtering**: Quickly filter rows with customizable input fields.
- **Sorting**: Sort your data by clicking on column headers.
- **Full Customization**: Use snippets and custom components to style and configure your table exactly how you want.

## 📅 What's Next?

This is just the beginning! Over the coming weeks, we'll be adding more robust examples, documentation, and a few extra bells and whistles.
